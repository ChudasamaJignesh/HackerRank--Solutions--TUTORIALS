Answer: -3/4

Step 1: Rewrite the 2 lines in proper form 
        Rewrite the 2 lines as:
            
            y = -2 + (-3/4) * x
            x = -7/4 + (-3/4) * y
        so b1 = -3/4 and b2 = -3/4

Step 2: Apply Pearson's Coefficient formula 
        Let p = pearson coefficient
        Let x_std = standard deviation of x
        Let y_std = standard deviation of y

            p = b1 (x_std / y_std)
            p = b2 (y_std / x_std)

    Multiplying these 2 equations together we get
            
            p^2 = b1 * b2
            p^2 = (-3/4) * (-3/4)
            p^2 = 9/16
            p = 3/4 or -3/4 (depending on correlation of x and y)


Step 3: Find out if p is postive or negative 

We simply plot 2 sets of (x,y) points to see if x and y are positively or negatively correlated.
In this case, they are negatively correlated, so p = -3/4
