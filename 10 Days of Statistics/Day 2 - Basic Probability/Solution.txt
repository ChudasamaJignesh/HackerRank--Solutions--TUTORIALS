Answer: 5/6

There are 6 possibilities on each die.
 {1,2,3,4,5,6}
On 2 dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possibilities -----[1]

There are 6 cases where sum >= 10
{(4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)} = 6 pairs --------[2]
 
 on the bases of [1] and [2] results
This gives us probability(sum >= 10) = 6/36 = 1/6

That means probability(sum <= 9) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6
