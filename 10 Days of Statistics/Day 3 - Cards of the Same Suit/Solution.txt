Answer: 12/51

There are 13 of each suit in a deck.

We can view this as 2 separate events. First we draw 1 card and see what suit it is. 
Whatever suit it is, there are 12 of the same matching suit remaining in the 51-card deck. 
Therefore, when we draw the 2nd card, there is a 12/51 chance that it is the same suit.
